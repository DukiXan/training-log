# Training Log

~~Just a CRUD application for playing around.~~ 

To be more specific: Laravel application where users can log their activities throughout days. Initially a "training-log" (for tracking my gainz), but can be user as a diary for anything. I'm still updating it every now and then.

## Installation

* Clone (git clone https://github.com/DukiXan/training-log.git folder_name)
* Create adequate .env file
* Run composer (composer install)
* Migrate (php artisan migrate)
